                <p>Im not good at making letters TT so please dont cringe at it. Iniisip ko kanina kung ano nga ba ilalagay ko dito but I guess the right thing to write here is how I appreciate you and why should you appreciate yourself more. It's kinda funny to me that we started talking on a dating app because we are both bored and that our first convo is about how I hate people there being "shallow" and you agreed.. That interaction is so comical yet we are good friends now, but all of those aside I just wanna say thank you. I don't know how to share what i feel most of the time because I dont wanna burden others just by listening to me but with you, I feel safe and can almost talk about anything really. I feel like I could trust you with my whole life and you wouldn't let me down thats how good you are as person RC, I admire everything about you. I can't like put all of the things i admire you for here tho but if you want i will provide an Excel Sheet for you to browse upon lol. So dont underappreciate yourself ever, cuz in the lenses of the people you love, you are more than enough. Take care of yourself palagi <33</p>
